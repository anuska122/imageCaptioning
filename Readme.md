### Image Captioning Project
- This project implements an Image Captioning system that generates descriptive captions for images using a CNN + LSTM architecture. It combines computer vision and natural language processing to create a pipeline from image input to text output.

### Features
- It generates human-readable captions for input images.
- Custom vocabulary built from training captions.
- CNN-based encoder for image feature extraction is used.
- LSTM-based decoder for sequence generation.
- Supports full training and inference pipelines.
- Configurable for debugging or full dataset training.

### Dataset
- This project uses the Flickr8k dataset (8,000 images with captions).
